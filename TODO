TODO
----

* When coming back from media fragment, the order of alarms was all weird. Why
  is that? This was after hitting cancel but occurred for OK as well. Also when
  going back to the media fragment after changing the directory, it would not
  reload to the path of the music that is selected for the alarm.

* Make sure to grep all TODO even layout resources before production

* Remove all print statements and TODO statements that were added, before releasing to production.

* Run optimizer to make sure all the code is good and unused resources are removed before production

* Change name of notification objects to notification builders

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* When active alarm or timer is left. Then "nfcTags" has to get reinitialized
  and probably gets cleared. May need to save the current progress in
  onSavedInstanceState() or whatever it is called.

* A repeat option for the timer could simply be number of times to repeat?
  How would keep track of how many times it has been repeated?

* Add default timer in Settings

* When using TTS, volume seems to get louder when coming back to music, and
  then goes down a bit. Is that intentional? Scope revertVolume() as well.

* Opened media activity, started on ringtone. Swipeed over to browse. Selected
  Etta James I'd rather go blind. When I cam eback to main activity, the alarm
  card was colored like it was expanded but it was not actually expanded. It
  should have been expanded.

* Alarm time in activity was not updating until turned on screen. May not be an important bug.

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* When updating to support API 36:

    - Bottom padding of settings is wack, and possibly in main activity as well

    - Test MediaActivity with edge-to-edge

* Start week on and next alarm format radio button colors are not themed

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy
