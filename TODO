* TODO: Need to dismiss the Dismiss Early notification after dismiss

* TODO: Start week on and next alarm format radio button colors are not themed

* TODO: Time was not updating in widget.

* TODO: When a 2 week repeat frequency is set, and you say to run on all days
  before starting, then you toggle off some of the days, could this cause an
  issue? I guess those days that are toggled off will not ever get run so maybe
  it is ok.

* TODO: Look up NacAlarm.build() and see if it is used without shared preferences. Should that be done?

* TODO: When repeating X weekly, where X > 1, need to figure out what to do about repeat days because I feel like the logic I have is wrong.

* When updating to support API 36:

    - Bottom padding of settings is wack, and possibly in main activity as well

    - Test MediaActivity with edge-to-edge

* Check that selected directory for music works.

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* In NacCardHolder, do I always want to do the haptic jank whenever a button is clicked?

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy
