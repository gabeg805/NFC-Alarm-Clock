* TODO: NFC tag dropdown usability is strange and needs to be fixed
* TODO: In NacCardHolder, do I always want to do the haptic jank whenever a button is clicked?
* TODO: Start week on and next alarm format radio button colors are not themed
* TODO: Bottom padding of settings is wack, and possibly in main activity as well
* TODO: Test MediaActivity with edge-to-edge
* TODO: Scheduled a date alarm and it ran immediately.  Need to investigate this.

* Different repeat options, someone even wants monthly.  Should I just add a
  calendar?  How would I handle showing the date it's going to alarm?

* Check that selected directory for music works.

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* Look up defaults like for auto dismiss, dismiss early, .... really all the
  times, and see if they should be in the resources directory?

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy

* Long press repeat, NFC, and flashlight for quick options

* Overlay number over repeat button for custom repeat option?
