* Power/volume button to snooze?

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* Different repeat options, someone even wants monthly.  Should I just add a
  calendar?  How would I handle showing the date it's going to alarm?

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* Add notification to dismiss early?

* Snooze with physical buttons?

* Add option to use multiple NFC tags in order/random to dismiss.

* Check that selected directory for music works.

* Look up defaults like for auto dismiss, dismiss early, .... really all the
  times, and see if they should be in the resources directory?

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy

* Long press repeat, NFC, and flashlight for quick options

* Overlay number over repeat button for custom repeat option?

* Have option to scroll alarm name instead of marquee it
