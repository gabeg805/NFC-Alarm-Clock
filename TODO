* When browsing music, clicking on the media button and having the media
  activity open up for the first time, the music order gets all jumbled. Need
  to figure out why this is.

* Alarm was not acting like a full screen intent in Android 15. Why is that?

* Alarm time in activity was not updating until turned on screen. May not be an important bug.

* Test multiple alarms that occur at the same time

* Test date picker when alarm has a date

* Check that selected directory for music works.

    Selecting a folder does not change the media name in the card. Need to fix that

    File not found for Music/Arctic Monkeys/<Song>. Need to make sure doing path correctly

* Remove all print statements and TODO statements that were added, before releasing to production.

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* When updating to support API 36:

    - Bottom padding of settings is wack, and possibly in main activity as well

    - Test MediaActivity with edge-to-edge

* In NacCardHolder, do I always want to do the haptic jank whenever a button is clicked?

* Start week on and next alarm format radio button colors are not themed

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy
