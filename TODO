* Need to figure out coloring for Date and Time picker

* TODO: Time was not updating in widget.

* When updating to support API 36:

    - Bottom padding of settings is wack, and possibly in main activity as well

    - Test MediaActivity with edge-to-edge

* Check that selected directory for music works.

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* In NacCardHolder, do I always want to do the haptic jank whenever a button is clicked?

* Should NacAlarm.build() for alarm options be done everywhere? Like in upcoming reminder dialog?

* Start week on and next alarm format radio button colors are not themed

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy
