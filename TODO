* Bring back upcoming alarm notification?

* Add notification to dismiss early?

* Snooze with physical buttons?

* Move easy to mess up strings to top

* Improve look of warning selected directory dialog

* Look up defaults like for auto dismiss, dismiss early, .... really all the
  times, and see if they should be in the resources directory?

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy

* Long press repeat, NFC, and flashlight for quick options

* Overlay number over repeat button for custom repeat option?

* Have option to scroll alarm name instead of marquee it
