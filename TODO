TODO
----

* Run optimizer to make sure all the code is good and unused resources are removed before production

* What's new dialog seemed to show up twice. Investigate this.

* Change name of notification objects to notification builders

* Add default timer in Settings

* Add loading thing when loading media activity

* When using TTS, volume seems to get louder when coming back to music, and
  then goes down a bit. Is that intentional? Scope revertVolume() as well.

* Opened media activity, started on ringtone. Swipeed over to browse. Selected
  Etta James I'd rather go blind. When I cam eback to main activity, the alarm
  card was colored like it was expanded but it was not actually expanded. It
  should have been expanded.

* Test alarms at the same time one more time, and just make sure you do not
  need to show the notification that was being done when restarting service.

* When browsing music, clicking on the media button and having the media
  activity open up for the first time, the music order gets all jumbled. Need
  to figure out why this is.

* Alarm was not acting like a full screen intent in Android 15. Why is that?

* Alarm time in activity was not updating until turned on screen. May not be an important bug.

* Remove all print statements and TODO statements that were added, before releasing to production.

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* When updating to support API 36:

    - Bottom padding of settings is wack, and possibly in main activity as well

    - Test MediaActivity with edge-to-edge

* Start week on and next alarm format radio button colors are not themed

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy
