TODO
----

* When active alarm or timer is left. Then "nfcTags" has to get reinitialized
  and probably gets cleared. May need to save the current progress in
  onSavedInstanceState() or whatever it is called.

* MissedNotification, snackbar, media activity, NFC. Maybe consolidating some stuff that can be classes?

* Make sure to grep all TODO even layout resources before production

* How will scanning NFC work using fragments instead of activities now?
  Can maybe handle this with LiveData?

* A repeat option for the timer could simply be number of times to repeat?
  How would keep track of how many times it has been repeated?

* Run optimizer to make sure all the code is good and unused resources are removed before production

* What's new dialog seemed to show up twice. Investigate this.

* Change name of notification objects to notification builders

* Add default timer in Settings

* Add loading thing when loading media activity

* When using TTS, volume seems to get louder when coming back to music, and
  then goes down a bit. Is that intentional? Scope revertVolume() as well.

* Opened media activity, started on ringtone. Swipeed over to browse. Selected
  Etta James I'd rather go blind. When I cam eback to main activity, the alarm
  card was colored like it was expanded but it was not actually expanded. It
  should have been expanded.

* Alarm was not acting like a full screen intent in Android 15. Why is that?

* Alarm time in activity was not updating until turned on screen. May not be an important bug.

* Remove all print statements and TODO statements that were added, before releasing to production.

* Stream internet radio, like KEXP?

* German translation bad: Clear reminder -> Erinnerung ausblenden
About -> Ãœber
(Statistics) Turned down Alams -> Abgeschaltete Alarme

* When updating to support API 36:

    - Bottom padding of settings is wack, and possibly in main activity as well

    - Test MediaActivity with edge-to-edge

* Start week on and next alarm format radio button colors are not themed

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy
